# Pokémon TCG

This is a disassembly of Pokémon TCG.

It uses the following ROM as a base:

- Pokémon Trading Card Game (U) [C][!].gbc `sha1: 0f8670a583255cff3e5b7ca71b5d7454d928fc48`

To assemble, first download RGBDS (https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/releases) and extract it to /usr/local/bin.
Copy the above ROM to this directory as "baserom.gbc".
Run `make` in your shell.

This will output a file named "poketcg.gbc".
